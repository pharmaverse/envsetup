\title{Environment Setup Environment}
\format{
An environment object created with \code{new.env()}.
}
\usage{
envsetup_environment
}
\description{
A dedicated environment object used to store and manage path configurations
and other setup variables for the envsetup package. This environment provides
an isolated namespace for storing path objects that can be retrieved using
the package's path management functions.
}
\details{
This environment serves as the default storage location for path objects
when using envsetup package functions. It helps maintain clean separation
between user workspace and package-managed paths.
}
\examples{
# Store a path in the envsetup environment
assign("project_root", "/path/to/project", envir = envsetup_environment)

# List objects in the environment
ls(envir = envsetup_environment)

# Check if the environment exists and is an environment
exists("envsetup_environment")
is.environment(envsetup_environment)
