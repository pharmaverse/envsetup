Description: The purpose of this package is to support the setup the R environment.  
    The two main features are 'autos', to automatically source files and/or 
    directories into your environment, and 'paths' to consistently set path objects 
    across projects for input and output. Both are implemented using a configuration 
    file to allow easy, custom configurations that can be used for multiple 
    or all projects.
