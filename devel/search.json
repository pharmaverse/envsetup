Now let’s go one step imagine programmer, ’ll call Tidy McVerse.

DEV first, meaning locations checked object found nothing found. Let’s now add environment PROD. simply change envsetup_environ DEV PROD, DEV wouldn’t work. need add configuration PROD. write new config use . Let’s write envsetup_environ variable check now PROD. ! isn’t PROD. must pass configuration config:get() telling use PROD.
